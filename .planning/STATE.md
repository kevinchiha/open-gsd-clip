## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 6 phases derived from 43 requirements across 6 categories, following foundation -> state -> agents -> sequential -> parallel -> UX build order
- Roadmap: Custom pipeline FSM (not XState) per research recommendation -- XState actor model fights Paperclip's event-driven model
- Roadmap: Git worktrees for parallel phases (Phase 5) per research -- single branch concurrent git commands corrupt working tree

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flag: Plugin SDK (@paperclipai/plugin-sdk) not published to npm -- Phase 1 must implement JSON-RPC stdio protocol manually against PLUGIN_SPEC.md
- Research flag: Zod version must match @paperclipai/shared peer dependency exactly -- verify before writing schemas
- Research flag: Git worktree compatibility with Paperclip's claude_local adapter needs empirical validation in Phase 5
